# Spark Playground

## Overview

Welcome to the Spark Playground Project! This project aims to setup Apache Spark integration with other technologies using only docker-compose. These can help as first step for diving into Spark and exploring its capabilities or they can be used for other projects, as part of unit tests or deployed as is for local testing. 
It will be developed in multiple phases, progressively adding new features and capabilities.
